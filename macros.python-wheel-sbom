# The macros in this file are used to add SBOM to wheel files that we ship.
# Majority of Python packages will not need to do that,
# as they only use wheels as an intermediate artifact.
# The macros will be used by packages installing wheel to %%python_wheel_dir
# or by Python interpreters bundling their own (patched) wheels.
#
# The runtime dependencies are not Required by the python-rpm-macros package,
# users of this macro need to specify them on their own or rely on the fact that
# they are all available in the default buildroot.
#
# Usage: %%python_wheel_inject_sbom PATHS_TO_WHEELS
#
# The wheels are modified in-place.
